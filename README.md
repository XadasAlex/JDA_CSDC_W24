### Discord Bot Management Tool
Created as our Project for W24 in CSDC at FH-Campus Wien.

#### Setup:
##### adding the Token & ApiKey for DiscordBot & Openai in the env variables read using System.getEnv() in Java
- discord: DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
- openai: OPENAI_API_KEY

##### Intellij might need a restart to recognize the changes.


##### You may find API keys in older commits, but they have been reverted. Don't even try to take advantage of my stupidity.
